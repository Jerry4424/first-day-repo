        Wikis are powered by wiki software, also known as wiki engines. 
        Being a form of content management system, these differ from other 
        web-based systems such as blog software or static site generators in 
        that the content is created without any defined owner or leader. 
        <em>Wikis have little inherent structure, allowing one to emerge according 
        to the needs of the users.</em> Wiki engines usually allow content to be 
        written using a lightweight markup language and sometimes edited with 
        the help of a rich-text editor.

        There are hundreds of thousands of wikis in use, both public and private, 
        including wikis functioning as knowledge management resources, note-taking 
        tools, community websites, and intranets. Ward Cunningham, the developer of 
        the first wiki software, WikiWikiWeb, originally described wiki as <q>the 
        simplest online database that could possibly work</q>.'Wiki' is a Hawaiian 
        word meaning <q>Quick</q>.
